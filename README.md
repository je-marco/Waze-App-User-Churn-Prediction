# Predicting Churn of Waze App Users  

## Overview
The goal of this project is to use the Waze app user data to build a binomial logistic regression, random forest model and extreme gradient boosting(XGBoost) model to predict whether the user will churn or not. For the purposes of this project, churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled or stopped using the app. This project focuses on monthly user churn. 

*Throughout this project, you'll see references to the problem-solving framework, PACE. The python notebook components are labeled with the respective PACE stages: Plan, Analyze, Construct, and Execute.**
